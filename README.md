**Preprocessing**: The video frames (or camera feed) are captured and preprocessed for analysis.
**Hand Detection and Tracking**: The system locates and tracks the user's hands within the frame.
**Feature Extraction**: Relevant features are extracted from the hand region, such as hand shape, finger positions, and orientation.
**Model Training (if applicable)**: A machine learning model (e.g., convolutional neural networks) is trained on a dataset of labeled sign language videos. This training allows the model to learn the association between hand features and specific signs.
**Sign Recognition**: The trained model is used to classify the hand features in new videos (or live feed) and identify the most likely sign being formed.
**Why Use This?**

Bridge communication gaps for people who use sign language.
Develop educational tools for learning sign language.
Create more accessible human-computer interfaces.
